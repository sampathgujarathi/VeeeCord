**fakeProfile** is a plugin for **Vencord** that supports all features related to nitro profile editing `without` the need to use individual plugins to create a complete profile with features such as:
 - Custom banner (Animated)
 - Custom avatar (Animated)
 - Choose custom badges
 - Choose profile effect (Without Nitro)
 - Choose profile theme colors (Without Nitro)
 - Choose custom decoration (Coming Soon...)
 - Reload database without restart client (This plugin used `/reload` to reload database)

 In **Command Prompt** used this command:

 git clone https://github.com/sampathgujarathi/fakeProfile.git

 After typing the command line, wait until the download is completed and then type:
 ```shell
 pnpm build
 ```
 And that all. Now you can restart Discord and check **fakeProfile** in **Plugins** setting.

 ### 3. How to update fakeProfile plugin?

 That all. Restart your Discord client and enjoy.

## ‚ùîQnA
 ### 1. Can everyone in Discord see my profile?
 - No, everyone in Discord will not see about your Profile change but in case if they also use the fakeProfile plugin then they will see your change.
 ### 2. If I leave the Discord server, will everything on my profile be lost?
 - No, because your requests will be saved in the plugin's database, so if you leave the server, everything will not be affected. *(unless you turn off the fakeProfile plugin, everything will return to the way it was when you didn't use this plugin)*
 ### 3. So what happens if I disable fakeProfile plugin?
 - As I answered in the 2nd QnA, everything will return to the way it was before you used this plugin. Of course, you can still turn it back on if you want to use it, but if you don't want to use it anymore, you have the right to turn this plugin off.
